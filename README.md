# Sticky Table

Responsive and dynamically-sized fixed headers and columns for tables.

Inspired by [fixed-data-table](https://github.com/facebook/fixed-data-table)'s lack of responsiveness.

[Demo](https://we-flow.github.io/react-sticky-table/)

### Features

- Multiple (and optional) fixed columns & headers
- Responsive table dimensions (wrap it in any size container and it will fill that container)
- Dynamic row height & column width (no need to specify width and height in pixels)
- Rows and columns resize as content resizes
- Custom cells
- Supports `overflow: scroll` on both axes
