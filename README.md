# Sticky Table Demo

Intended to show off React Sticky Table!

### Building

- run `npm run build` on this branch (`gh-pages`)
- Copy and paste `index.html` from `/build/index.html` to `/index.html`
  - Set `<base href="https://we-flow.github.io/react-sticky-table/">` in `<head>` tag
  - Prepend both the css and js links to the built files with `build` so they look like `href="build/static/..` and are relative paths so they adhere to the `<base>` tag.
